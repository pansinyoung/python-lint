476. Stone Game
There is a stone game.At the beginning of the game the player picks n piles of stones in a line.

The goal is to merge the stones in one pile observing the following rules:

At each step of the game,the player can merge two adjacent piles to a new pile.
The score is the number of stones in the new pile.
You are to determine the minimum of the total score.

Example
Example 1:

Input: [3, 4, 3]
Output: 17
Example 2:

Input: [4, 1, 1, 4]
Output: 18
Explanation:
  1. Merge second and third piles => [4, 2, 4], score = 2
  2. Merge the first two piles => [6, 4]ï¼Œscore = 8
  3. Merge the last two piles => [10], score = 18
