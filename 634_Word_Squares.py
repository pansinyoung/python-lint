634. Word Squares
Given a set of words without duplicates, find all word squares you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y
Example
Example 1:

Input:
["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
Output:
[["wall","area","lead","lady"],["ball","area","lead","lady"]]

Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
Example 2:

Input:
["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
Output:
 [["baba","abat","baba","atan"],["baba","abat","baba","atal"]]
Notice
There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
All words will have the exact same length.
Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
